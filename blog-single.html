                                    React is a UI library created by Meta to build reactive apps based on event
                                    triggers. In a traditional approach, a website reloads when data needs to be
                                    changed, which means when something is clicked, the whole page reloads to show
                                    another state which in most cases can be slow to reload.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Furthermore, the concept of using React components stops the reprocessing of every
                                    code or logic for that particular page. React components can be stateless or
                                    stateful and only re-render within the scope of the applied state.

                                    React is built to be declarative. That means you get to decide the workflow. You get
                                    to control how your app works, making React a powerful tool.

                                <h5 class="article-title">Easy to Learn</h5>
                                <p>


                                    Currently, the educational state of React.js is good because, over the years, React
                                    has grown with its community, and the community has made thousands of materials
                                    available for reference. The good supply of documentation and tutorial videos makes
                                    React.js a good catch.
                                </p>
                                <h5 class="article-title"> JavaScript Syntax Extension</h5>
                                <p>
                                    JSX is a JavaScript syntax extension that makes writing dynamic web apps in React.js
                                    easier. JSX code is compiled to JavaScript, and the Babel compiler will
                                    automatically optimize your code for performance.

                                    JavaScript syntax extension code is also type-safe, and its type checker will help
                                    you catch errors in your code. JSX is an important part of React.js, and it is
                                    recommended that you use JSX when developing React.js applications.
                                </p>

                                <h5 class="article-title"> Reusable Components</h5>

                                <p>
                                    React is a powerful JavaScript library that enables developers to create Reusable
                                    User Interfaces (UI). A key feature of React is the ability to create Components,
                                    which are self-contained units of code that can be reused throughout your app. This
                                    means that you can build your UI from small, reusable pieces, making your code more
                                    readable and maintainable.
                                </p>
                                <h5 class="article-title"> Performance Enhancement</h5>

                                <p> One of the reasons for its success is its performance. React uses a virtual DOM to
                                    manage updates to the user interface. This makes React apps fast and responsive.
                                    When a user interacts with a React app, only the relevant parts of the DOM are
                                    updated. This means that there is no need to redraw the entire page. This makes
                                    React apps much faster than traditional JavaScript frameworks.

                                    In addition, React can be used with other libraries and frameworks to create even
                                    more powerful applications. For these reasons, React is an excellent choice for
                                    building high-performance user interfaces.
                                </p>

                                    React.js Is SEO Friendly</h5>
                                <p>

                                    React.js is a JavaScript library that is used for building user interfaces. It is
                                    also known for its speedy performance and small size. React.js is SEO friendly
                                    because it uses server-side rendering. This means that the content of your React.js
                                    application will be rendered on the server before it is sent to the client. This can
                                    help to improve your website's search engine optimization because the content will
                                    be visible to search engines as soon as it is rendered.

                                    React.js applications are typically very well-structured, which can also help
                                    improve your website's SEO. If you are looking to build a fast, lightweight web
                                    application that is also SEO-friendly, React.js may be the perfect option for you.

                                <p>


                                    React.js has gained a lot of popularity in recent years due to its high pace of
                                    development. However, this has also led to some disadvantages for developers.

                                    One of the biggest problems is that React.js is constantly changing, and it can be
                                    difficult to keep up with the latest improvements. This means that developers need
                                    to invest a lot of time in keeping up with the React ecosystem, which can be a
                                    deterrent for some people.

                                    Additionally, the high pace of development can also lead to some bugs and
                                    instability in React applications.
                                </p>

                                <h5 class="article-title">
                                    Complex Documentation</h5>
                                <p>


                                    As any React developer knows, the React documentation is essential for learning how
                                    to use the library. However, as the library grows in size and complexity, the
                                    documentation has become increasingly difficult to navigate.

                                    In addition, many of the examples are outdated, and there is often little
                                    explanation of how the code works.

                                    As a result, developers have to spend a lot of time searching for answers to their
                                    questions. This problem is compounded by the fact that React is constantly changing,
                                    and new features are constantly added.

                                    In order to keep up with the ever-changing landscape, developers need to spend a
                                    significant amount of time reading through the documentation. Consequently, React
                                    documentation has become a major barrier to entry for new developers.
                                </p>


                                <h5 class="article-title">

                                    Re-Rendering</h5>
                                <p>




                                    React component life-cycle makes React re-render unnecessarily. React web apps are
                                    all made up of components, and when there is a change, Reacts checks for the change
                                    and renders it, but it may meet an unexpected change due to how JavaScript handles
                                    comparisons and equality. Such unintended change can cause unnecessary re-rendering.

                                    React is a UI library created by Meta to build reactive apps based on event
                                    triggers. In a traditional approach, a website reloads when data needs to be
                                    changed, which means when something is clicked, the whole page reloads to show
                                    another state which in most cases can be slow to reload.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Furthermore, the concept of using React components stops the reprocessing of every
                                    code or logic for that particular page. React components can be stateless or
                                    stateful and only re-render within the scope of the applied state.

                                    React is built to be declarative. That means you get to decide the workflow. You get
                                    to control how your app works, making React a powerful tool.

                                <p>The following features made React edge over other frameworks:

                                    <li> JavaScript Syntax Extension (JSX)</li>
                                    <li> Component</li>
                                    <li>
                                        Virtual DOM</li>
                                    <li> One-way data binding</li>

                                <p>


                                    Next.js supports static site generation and server-side rendering. Static generation
                                    is fast because all web application pages have been pre-rendered, cached, and served
                                    over a CDN.

                                    Server-side rendering is fast as the server handling the request, but on request,
                                    these pages are already built on the server rather than being built on the client
                                    side. </p>

                                    does not affect the size bundle of your client-side application. </p>

                                <h5 class="article-title"> Built-In CSS Support</h5>

                                <p>
                                    One of the key features of Next.js is its built-in CSS support. This means that
                                    developers can include CSS Stylesheets within their Next.js projects without needing
                                    to use any additional libraries or tooling. This can be particularly useful for
                                    small projects where adding a CSS preprocessor would add unnecessary complexity.
                                    <br>
                                    In addition, the built-in CSS support means that developers can take advantage of
                                    features such as server-side rendering and code splitting without having to worry
                                    about whether their CSS will be properly processed.

                                    Building a Next.js application requires a significant upfront investment. Not only
                                    do you need developers who are familiar with Nextjs, but you also need to dedicate
                                    ongoing resources to maintaining the application. </p>

                                    Routing System</h5>
                                <p>

                                    Next.js's routing system is helpful, but it comes at a cost. By tightly coupling
                                    your routing logic to your pages, you make your pages heavier and more difficult to
                                    maintain. This can be a serious problem if you need to change your routes frequently
                                    or want to reuse your routing logic in other parts of your application. </p>
